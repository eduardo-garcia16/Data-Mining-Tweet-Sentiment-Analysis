@MyaNikitaEtc @010_10_101 @aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad I could see those numbers climb much higher than that of the post millennials come out strong for Sanders since they will # over 80+ Mil. in 2020 and are mostly progressives! Sanders wins by a country mile!

@Holahoo1 @kkreitman @AntichristAlive @AlanaLelo @Levi6976 @LaalahMowhak33 @DigitalArtStud4 @ArtistBlerd @ida_skibenes @aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad @FBI @SecretService I see more of a poorly crafted effort at supprting 2A, and suggesting socialism will infringe on that. Regardless, that‚Äôs just my take. If people are genuinely concerned about child abuse, reporting to CPS in good faith is appropriate for them.

@ucsdydsa @BernieSanders Did Bernie pay for their meds? No he only wants to help people with other people‚Äôs money not his own.  He is a millionaire.

@tomaskenn @solon594bce @BernieSanders More proof @BarackObama
@POTUS44
is a SELLOUT AND WORKS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT. I lost respect for him long ago. During the financial crisis, he bailed out the banks, not ppl. RT

@a2runner @BernieSanders LOL that is not how that works. Like, not even close.

@FloridaGOP @BernieSanders The hourly onslaught of fiction broadcast by #GOPFraud requires a constant counter to it's lies and right wing propaganda. https://t.co/7PJ2nl6g4D

Google is too big, too powerful, and its anti-worker actions will end when we are in the White House. We are going to break up Google and stand up for workers against powerful tech monopolies. https://t.co/vYBYoSkowa

@katiecannon2 @healthcareAshi @RoKhanna @BernieSanders  Just as the #GND makes sure that displaced energy sector workers are taken care of, the displaced health care workers should be given the same courtesy

This is an emergency. We can not afford half measures.

I am proud to have introduced the only plan that will address the crisis we face. We need a Green New Deal now. https://t.co/nyoW9SwsQv

@BernieSanders @RobertJPeters Nice, they made this just for you @BarackObama https://t.co/Xs8Uk9d9Nk

@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad Congrats on admitting you will be a domestic terrorist if your preferred candidate doesn‚Äôt win.

@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad You don‚Äôt understand what a social democracy is do you

@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad Statistically they‚Äôre more likely to shoot you

We are going to ensure that no one pays more than $200 a year for the prescription drugs they need.

@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad Teaching your kids how to murder?
OK, sure.
===
@DanielS18554072 @BernieSanders Thank you for setting this great and needed example! 

Registering as a Democrat doesn't endorse the party. It helps Bernie and the country.

Much appreciated! :-)
===
@alan2102z @YangYouToo @WilesWj @BernieSanders I the future where we embrace furthered efficiencies that end jobs instead of rejecting them 12k will go further then it does now as human labor is frequently the largest cost of a product. Also, If you work 8 or 16 hours at a whatever job you will probably be well over that 12k

@Davidwfowler67 @BurinskasJoe @SFDukie @abeauchemin87 @progressive_va @aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad @Twitter @jack Someone needs to get a sense of humor, lighten up, it's just a joke, hahaha? You know, like what you say people need when a prick with a gun threatens mass murder?

@jonshelley @gillsterein @vote20208 @EmersonPolling @BernieSanders @PeteButtigieg It's a primary.

@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad Yikes. That's some real soy-latte level grouping there.

Name it  shame it - boycott or raid them - make them put surrogates on - not just Michael Moore 
How about @CornelWest ?
And yes they should cover yang honestly too 

@jackiembouvier: @ninaturner @johncusack @MSNBC @BernieSanders Thank you, @johncusack.‚Äù

@BernieSanders I live in a closed primary state and did a thing I vowed never to do, I registered Democrat so I could vote for Bernie in the primary. Find out if you also live in a closed primary state and do the same fellow indies (They can‚Äôt stop you from switching back after you vote).

@bass_pin @XposeGunControl @leschleser @ladyljd @Grammar91427465 @lifesafeast @aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad All I can do is laugh at your sh*t education and right-wing propaganda driven understanding of Canada. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad Teaching your children to be murderous cowards. I hope they outgrow your immaturity and become better people than you.

===
@BernieSanders Which means that he will welcome Google and get personal information on its users, just saying.
===
@BernieSanders I like this man so very much. He is so down to earth, spirit filled and cares about all people...well except for Putin and you know who.
===
@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad Lol garbage
===
Getting my boys trained up on how to use a gun in the unlikely event @BernieSanders beats @realDonaldTrump in 2020. In which case knowing how to effectively use a gun under socialism will be a must. By the way most the head shots were theirs. @NRA @WatchChad #2ndAmendment https://t.co/6xUsS7ciX3

@BluZar @morgana_SSS @aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad Isn't it interesting that the people who complain the most about darker skinned immigrants and socialism are impacted less by the former and depend more on the later than the rest of us who don't?

Mike Bloomberg announced his candidacy in the same week new polls show @BernieSanders surging in crucial early primary/caucus states...and now Bloomberg is saying he‚Äôs going to avoid running in those states LOL https://t.co/cUSyQ1x50b

@CoboOlsi @dad_plaid @LockedDoorway @SGTHaze @BernieSanders The other guy is arguing against saying Google isn't currently a Monopoly because he took a Economics class or something and probably means the literal legal they don't own 70% or more of something that you can't really measure in this case because it's not a material resource.

Negative Tweets:
@bornwithatail_ @SGTHaze @BernieSanders They will get to vote which is why I find all these accounts with 20 followers suddenly popping in and trying to convince everyone Bernie is a dictator kinda weird.

@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad Big guns little...
===
@Trillburne @aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad What a strange thing to insult the guy who just threatened to shoot politicans he doesn't agree with and is brainwashing his children to do the same.
===
@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad Please get the psychiatric help you and your family desperately need, before your kids end up shooting their classmates.

@Jell0wYell0w @XposeGunControl @leschleser @ladyljd @Grammar91427465 @lifesafeast @aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad You don't know the correct definition of a state, wow. State, Nation, and Country all mean the same thing dullard.
===
@rock_dove1013 @aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad Just a brief anecdote: I had extreme anxiety and depression for over a decade. I couldn't afford to see a therapist, and even once I could I felt that ridiculous stigma against doing so.

When I finally did, it was a huge weight off my shoulders.
===
If @BarackObama were really concerned about his legacy as a human being, he'd join forces with @BernieSanders, instead of shilling for the corrupt system we are working to end, and help us accomplish what he promised in 2008.
===
@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad I count 21 shots that missed entirely. You're auditioning for the wrong stormtroopers.
===
We have got to end the private prison and detention racket in America, and reverse the racist criminalization of immigration. It is disgusting that ICE is trying to fast-track private prison contracts, which is why I support the California ban. https://t.co/GNskIb9zZX
===
@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad This is disturbing. This tweet and the message it's sending is terribly disturbing. If I were 'in charge of things' you'd be on a watch list.
===
@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad Still waiting for Obama to take my guns. 

But seriously, conservatives killed Minutemen. They killed Union soldiers. They killed civil rights workers. They killed children. Journalists. They killed worshipers in church. They‚Äôve killed in synagogues. They will kill again.

@TheGentleDonN @LeftwardSwing @jsam_j @MrsZiggy1988 @BernieSanders @PoliticalAnt @Me Now we're getting into guessing games.

There's no good reason to block aid. Period.

@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad You probably have some nooses already made up too, don‚Äôt you?

I guess you‚Äôve already shown the little guy how to get his hate turned way up high when he‚Äôs helping you make those nooses, didn‚Äôt you?

@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad #MAGAts just out here raising the next generation of school shooters like... WTF?!?

@aubrey_huff @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NRA @WatchChad Yeah, looking at this guy I probably should buy in case idiots decide to take on normal people
